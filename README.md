📝Simple Keylogger📝
Using Tkinter, this code creates a Simple Keylogger that lets users record keystrokes in a specified text field.
Using buttons, users can begin and end logging, and the program records keystrokes and timestamps ⏰. 
A record of the user's input can be obtained by saving the logged keys to a text file 📂.
To ensure transparency, a warning message tells users that logging only takes place in the active window ♠️. 
All in all, it provides a clear illustration of keylogging features in an intuitive interface! 🖥
